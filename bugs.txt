Things we still need:
- review variable & method names, make sure all have clear and accurate names
- classes & class members all need Javadoc header comments
- map of the layout
- design justification (includes a discussion of at least one reasonable alternative data structure that could have been used, and the reasons why you decided against this alternative) for us: binary tree instead of mutable graph?
- architecture diagram describing the relationships between all classes; a class diagram showing how the data structures driving your game interact with one another

Things we COULD add:
- point system
- more gardening
- description as list
- more pizza making steps
- game over if tomato plant dies
- more game over outcomes
- do you want to try again
- randomize burnt pizza if no book
- save progress as txt file (list of fields you want to save, strings the comp could read w bufferwriter bufferreader)
